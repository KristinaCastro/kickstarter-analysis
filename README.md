## An Analysis on Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
Louise is an up & coming playwright who wants to start a fundraising campaign to fund her play “Fever.” Before she launches her campaign, we are analyzing the data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a project campaign successful. More specifically, Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared according to their launch dates & their funding goal. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
With the Dataset, using the Years () Functions I was able to pull the year of the campaign launch date, which is the information we need to make our analysis. Now that the data has the needed information, I inserted a pivot table to filter for the outcomes of only theater fundraisers according to their launch dates. Once my pivot table displayed the needed data, I then created a line graph to further show the correlation between theater fundraisers that were successful, failed or canceled and the month the fundraisers were launched.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81998045/115981803-90d31f80-a564-11eb-9498-e1b8c2aa7376.png)
